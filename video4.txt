<p>Q. WHEN <strong>JESUS CHRIST</strong> WAS RESURRECTED, HE WOULD APPEAR ON EARTH IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLESH, QUESTION IS WHILE IN HEAVEN, DOES HE AT TIMES CHANGE HIS APPEARANCE?</p>
<p>A. HERE ON EARTH ONE CAN DO THAT,BUT IN HEAVEN YOU CANNOT, FOR IN <strong>HEAVEN</strong>, IT IS YOUR <strong>TRUE SPIRITUAL BODY</strong>, YOURSELF, AND YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER PERSON AS THEY ARE SPIRITUALLY, BUT HERE ON EARTH ONE CAN CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE, JUST
    TO SEE, IF THE PEOPLE ON EARTH ARE LISTENING TO <strong>THE WORDS</strong>, OR ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FLESH.</p>
<p>SO IN HEAVEN HE IS THE SAME.</p>
<p>SAME KIND AND LOVING MAN I EVER KNOW, THAT IS JESUS.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS CHRIST</strong> IS CREATED LIKE THAT HE IS CREATED WITH A LOT OF <strong>PASSION</strong>, AND <strong>COMPASSION</strong>, HE IS JUST <strong>BEAUTIFUL</strong> AND <strong>MARVELOUS</strong> AND <strong>WONDERFUL</strong>, EVEN WHEN YOU ARE
    HAVING LIKE A TALK WITH HIM, EVERYTHING THAT <strong>HE SPEAKS</strong>, IT GETS THROUGH, JUST LIKE HE USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS HERE, EVEN WHEN THE PHARISEES WERE UP THERE AND FEELING SO MIGHTY, EVEN AT THE TIME OF DEATH REMEMBER, HE STILL FELT COMPASSION, HE
    STILL FELT SORRY FOR THEM, HE DIDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COULD NOT <strong>SEE </strong>AND <strong>HEAR</strong> <strong>THE TRUTH</strong>, THERE IS NO MAN WHO CAN DO THAT, AND YOU SEE, HE IS MADE VERY DIFFERENT, EVERYONE IS MADE DIFFERENT BUT FOR HIM, HE
    HAS A LOT TO OFFER AS JESUS, EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE A TALK WITH HIM IN HEAVEN, HIS WORDS GET THROUGH,&nbsp;<strong>THE WAY HE SPEAKS</strong>, THE WAY HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF, THE WAY HE LAUGHS, THE WAY HE WILL MAKE A JOKE, THE WAY HE WILL MAKE A CONVERSATION, IT IS
    JUST WONDERFUL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE IN PERSONALITY WITH THE WAY HE CAME AS <strong>SAVIOR</strong> AND <strong>NOW</strong> AS <strong>KING</strong></p>
<p>A.<span>&nbsp; </span>YES, THERE WILL BE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCE, FOR BEFORE WHEN HE CAME AS<strong> SAVIOR</strong>, HE CAME TO SAVE, THIS TIME HE WILL COME AND PICK AND GO WITH THE <strong>HOLY</strong>, AND AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT THAT HE IS NOT COMPASSIONATE, HE
    IS, BUT THIS TIME THE PURPOSE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT TIME, FOR THAT TIME, HE HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF MERCIES FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO <strong>GOD</strong>, BUT THIS TIME PEOPLE ARE LEFT TO DECIDE DEEP DOWN, SO HE WILL GO WITH THE WORTHY, THE ONES
    WHO ARE WORTHY TO RECEIVE HIM, SO THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p>DO YOU KNOW HOW <strong>THE EAGLE</strong> OF <strong>THE LORD</strong> LOOKS LIKE?</p>
<p>THERE IS THAT <strong>EAGLE</strong> THAT IS <strong>IN HEAVEN</strong>, IT SYMBOLIZES <strong>THE HOLYSPIRIT</strong>.</p>
<p>THERE IS A REAL EAGLE IN HEAVEN THAT FLIES, IT IS CALLED “<strong>THE EAGLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS</strong>” AND THIS IS THE LAST THING I WILL SPEAK ABOUT TODAY.</p>
<p>YOU JUST PICTURE IT, IT IS JUST THE WAY AN EAGLE LOOKS LIKE, IT HAS A <strong>BEAK</strong>, WHICH IS <strong>RED </strong>IN <strong>COLOR</strong>, ONE OF ITS<strong> FOOT</strong> IS <strong>BLUE</strong> AND THE OTHER <strong>ONE</strong> IS <strong>GREEN</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE RIGHT FOOT</strong> IS <strong>BLUE</strong>, AND <strong>THE LEFT FOOT</strong> IS <strong>GREEN</strong>.</p>
<p>THE FEATHERS ON ITS <strong>HEAD</strong>, ARE <strong>WHITE</strong>, BUT THE REST OF THE FEATHERS ON ITS ENTIRE BODY, ARE A MIXTURE OF COLORS ,ALL DIFFERENT COLORS YOU CAN NAME, THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE SHADES OF EACH COLOR IN EXISTENCE. AND IT IS MORE LIKE A <strong>RAINBOW COLOR</strong>.</p>
<p>ITS WING SPAN ALMOST COVERS THE ENTIRE HEAVEN WHEN IT FLIES. YOU CANNOT EVEN SEE THE END OF EACH WING. IF IT FLIES, AND FLAPS ITS WINGS, EVERYONE FEELS THE WIND OF ITS FLAPPING WINGS. IT IS SO AMAZING.</p>
<p>MANY PEOPLE WILL WAIT FOR THAT MOMENT CAUSE IT DOES NOT FLY OFTEN, ONLY ONCE IN<span>&nbsp; </span>A WHILE.</p>
<p>WHEN IT FLIES,MANY <strong>RESIDENTS OF HEAVEN</strong> WANT TO SIT ON ITS FEET, TO BE CARRIED BY IT AS IT FLIES, AND WHEN CARRIED YOU CAN SEE THE AERIAL VIEW OF HEAVEN, EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>IT RESIDES IN THE RESIDENCE OF <strong>THE LORD OF HOSTS</strong>.</p>
<p>WHEN IT FLIES IN HEAVEN, EVERYONE WILL SEE IT AS IT FLIES, AND EVERYONE WILL FEEL WHEN IT FLIES.</p>
<p>EVERYONE WILL NOTICE EVEN WHEN IT WANTS TO TAKE OFF, WHEN IT WANTS TO FLY, FOR IT WILL START TO FLAP IT WINGS BEFORE IT TAKES OFF.</p>
<p>AND EVERY PLACE IN HEAVEN, YOU WILL FEEL THE WIND.</p>
<p>IT CAN CARRY SO MANY, WHEN IT FLIES. IT IS SO HUGE.</p>
<p>AND IT UNDERSTANDS VERY WELL, AND ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT SPEAK, IT CAN EVEN READ YOU.</p>
<p>IT HAS A VERY SMALL EYE COMPARED TO ITS SIZE,YOU MAY THINK IT CANNOT SEE, AS ITS EYE IS SO SMALL, IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE CALL HERE ON EARTH “INFINITY MIRROR”. IT IS LIKE LINES OF COLORS THAT GO INSIDE THE EYE.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST</strong> COLOR OF LINE BEING<strong> RED</strong>, AND YOU CANNOT SEE THE END OF THE EYE, BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RED, THERE IS A LIGHT GREEN SPOT. ITS EYEBALL IS A SPOT OF GREEN AND THAT IS <strong>THE EAGLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS.</strong></p>
<p>AMEN.</p>

<p>AND TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE FORUM, TELL THEM<span>&nbsp; </span>TO KEEP MOVING, FOR ONE DAY THEY WILL SING ALLELUIA, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY IN THIS WORLD, FOR ANYONE WHO<strong> SERVES GOD</strong>, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE HARDSHIPS, BUT ALSO THERE
    IS ALWAYS GOOD THINGS AROUND THE HARDSHIPS, AND TELL THEM THAT <strong>GOD LOVES THEM VERY MUCH</strong>, AND WE ALL LOVE THEM VERY MUCH, UP THERE IN <strong>HEAVEN</strong> WE ALL LOVE THEM VERY MUCH, REGARDLESS OF THEIR WAYS, AS LONG AS SOMEONE IS KEEPING
    THEIR <strong>WAYS IN GOD </strong>AND <strong>LOVING GOD</strong>, AND WALKING IN <strong>THE WAYS OF GOD</strong>, AND IN <strong>THE STEPS OF GOD</strong>, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE <strong>CALLED BY THE NAME OF GOD</strong>, AND WE LOVE THEM SO MUCH AND
    WE ALWAYS PRAY FOR THEM.</p>
<p>YOU MIGHT THINK HEAVEN WE ARE ALWAYS HAVING FUN, SOMETIMES WE COME AND BE TOLD THAT THIS AND THAT IS HAPPENING ON EARTH, AND THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS QUIET, IT IS SILENT AND EVERYONE GOES TO THEIR CHAMBERS AND THEY <strong>CRY TO GOD</strong>, AND NOW THEY
    WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO WHAT WE HAVE ASKED.</p>
<p>SO <strong>HEAVEN PRAYS</strong> AND <strong>YOU PRAY</strong>, AND THINGS WORK OUT RIGHT, FOR <strong>GOD IS ALWAYS A CONQUEROR</strong>, HE HAS NEVER BEEN DEFEATED.</p>
<p>SO MAY <strong>OUR HEAVENLY FATHER</strong> BLESS ALL OF YOU SO MUCH.</p>
